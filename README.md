An exporter for metrics in the InfluxDB format used since 0.9.0. It collects
metrics in the
[line protocol][line_protocol] via a HTTP API,
transforms them and exposes them for consumption by Prometheus.

This exporter supports float, int and boolean fields. Tags are converted to Prometheus labels.

The exporter also listens on a UDP socket, port 9122 by default.

## Timestamps

By default metrics exposed without original timestamps like this:

```
http_requests_total{method="post",code="200"} 1027
http_requests_total{method="post",code="400"}    3
```

If you want to add original timestamps to exposed metrics, please use flag `--timestamps` and metrics will looks like:

```
http_requests_total{method="post",code="200"} 1027 1395066363000
http_requests_total{method="post",code="400"}    3 1395066363000
```

## Alternatives

If you are sending data to InfluxDB in Graphite or Collectd formats, see the
[graphite_exporter][graphite_exporter]
and [collectd_exporter][collectd_exporter] respectively.

This exporter is useful for exporting metrics from existing collectd setups, as
well as for metrics which are not covered by the core Prometheus exporters such
as the [Node Exporter][node_exporter].

The exporter acts like an InfluxDB server, it does not connect to one. For
metrics concerning the InfluxDB server, use the [metrics endpoint][influxdb_metrics]
built into InfluxDB.

If you are already using Telegraf, it can serve the same purpose as this
exporter with the [`outputs.prometheus_client`][telegraf] plugin.

For more information on integrating between the Prometheus and InfluxDB
ecosystems, see the [influxdata integration page][influx_integration].

## Example usage with Telegraf

The influxdb_exporter appears as a normal InfluxDB server. To use with Telegraf
for example, put the following in your `telegraf.conf`:

```
[[outputs.influxdb]]
  urls = ["http://localhost:9122"]
```

Or if you want to use UDP instead:
```
[[outputs.influxdb]]
  urls = ["udp://localhost:9122"]
```

Note that Telegraf already supports outputing Prometheus metrics over HTTP via
[`outputs.prometheus_client`][telegraf], which avoids having to also run the influxdb_exporter.
